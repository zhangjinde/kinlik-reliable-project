# README

The `main` branch only contains the skeleton code for [`reliable.c`](reliable.c). See `solution` branch for the actual project.

(Note: This is done because GitHub's [`robots.txt`](https://github.com/robots.txt) only permits search engines to crawl the default branch. The code is intended to be publicly accessible, but not easily searched by people to copy solutions.)
